      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I felt better and thought why not jump right into the Garmin Coach Training plan that I have been reading up on quite a bit.
I had my first Benchmark run today for this plan and also got the New Balance 1080v10s that I ordered today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Still hurt, still looking at half-marathon training plans and getting new shoes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
