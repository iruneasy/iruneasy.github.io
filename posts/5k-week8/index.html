    <p>Weekly Update #4</p>
<p>This was the last week of the 8 week 5k Plan I have been following. The good news, I got my 5k paced run done. The bad news, I am sick/hurt at the moment.</p>
<p>First, here is the weekly overview:
<img src="/img/weekly/garmin2020-w27.jpg" alt="weekly_stats_2020_week27"></p>
<p>Monday was a tempo run, going through multiple paces, nothing new but good fun.</p>
<p>I did my &ldquo;timed&rdquo; 5k run on Thursday because I was not sure if I could get a run in on Friday or Saturday.<br>
The <a href="https://www.nike.com/pdf/Nike-Run-Club-5K-Training-Plan-Audio-Guided-Runs.pdf">Nike Run Club 5k Training plan</a> gives a whole table of paces for people in different states of fitness/ability. Because it has been a while since I ran i started this plan on the slowest level of their pace table.
That translates to</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">1k pace</th>
<th align="center">5k pace</th>
<th align="center">10k pace</th>
<th align="center">recovery pace</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">7:30</td>
<td align="center">7:55</td>
<td align="center">8:10</td>
<td align="center">9:00</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This would translate to a 12:00 mile pace, you can do the rest of the math yourselves. :)<br>
Following this pace, this would set me up with a 39:30 5k time. I am aware that this is super slow. But I am just competing against myself and not against others. For me this is about finishing it and having fun doing it. Getting faster is something that will come with time.</p>
<p>For the run itself I did about an 800m warmup followed by a few minutes of dynamic stretches. In the last weeks I always felt sluggish on my long runs without having a proper warmup because i thought that at an easy recovery speed I don&rsquo;t need one (the training plan also didn&rsquo;t mention one, but does in interval/tempo/fartlek/hill workouts). With this warmup I was ready to go, no sluggish feeling!<br>
Just for the hell of it I did it without looking at my watch to get a gps pace estimate.<br>
Keep in mind the table above with the paces I was going for, here are the &ldquo;personal records&rdquo; I set this run:</p>
<p><img src="/img/weekly/garmin2020-w27pr.jpg" alt="weekly_stats_2020_week27pr"><br>
The first km was the 6:37min/km time, up till the 3k mark, i continued running below 7:00 min/km. Around the 3k mark I had to slow down to a slow jog for a around 20 seconds to get my breathing under control. I finished running an 7:10 min/km average for the whole distance, which means I was 4min faster than the pace I was aiming for. On one side, I now know that I can run a 5k faster than the target pace I set for myself which sounds good, on the other side, I couldn&rsquo;t pace myself at all. As I said, after 3k my breathing was all over the place. This is something I am not happy about. I guess if i kept the pace at around 7:15 min/km I could&rsquo;ve run the whole 5k still struggling, but without slowing down or have my breathing go out of control.</p>
<p>Friday was an easy recovery run.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s also when I started feeling a pain in my ribs. I had a slightly annoying feeling in my ribs since monday morning, when stretching after waking up. Which i thought was just me having slept in a weird position or something similar and I only felt it when I fully extended my arms which put a lot of pressure in my ribcage.<br>
At the end of the friday run, I had pain on the right side my ribcage while taking deep breaths which later throughout the day also happened on any major movement like sitting down/getting up or lifting something heavy enough for the muscles near the area to engange. After a visit to my GP, I ended up with the diagnosis of it being an inflammation, possibly from some viral infection and a prescription for some pain killers.<br>
Which led to me finding out that ibuprofen doesn&rsquo;t seem to do a good job for me on this, because as someone who usually falls asleep while lying on my side, that was impossible. I missed a lot of sleep the last 2 days and I have been in pain. No running at the moment. I hope that this will be gone in a few days.</p>
<p>But this is my 5k training plan done and now I have little bit of time to look for what to do next. I mentioned it in a previous post already, I am looking for a longer distance training plan, especially for a half marathon, which seems to be still managable timewise. I have looked at a few, nothing set in stone yet, might continue with the Nike HM plan, or maybe I might give the Garmin Coach Half Marathon feature which you have access to if you have a garmin watch a try, at least for a week or two to see what it will look like, since it seems to adapt itself to your performance. But I am meanwhile also looking at other plans, tons of them out there on the net.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week, thanks for reading. Hope to see you again!.</p>
