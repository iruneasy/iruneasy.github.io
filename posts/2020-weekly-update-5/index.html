    <p>This will be a short one this week.<br>
Still hurt, still looking at half-marathon training plans and getting new shoes.</p>
<p>Because of continuing rib pain, I haven&rsquo;t done a single run this week. Last night was the first night that I could actually sleep through again without waking up in pain because i rolled onto the wrong side. Still missing a lot of sleep, but hope to catch up soon. During the day today it barely hurt on the ribs when taking deep breaths, so looking good so far.<br>
I will try my first run again as soon as it stops hurting while I breath.</p>
<p>I still am planning to start with a half-marathon training plan next but still haven&rsquo;t decided which one. But if everything goes alright, I will have chosen one by next sunday and will start that on the following monday, at least that is the plan so far.</p>
<p>I also ordered new shoes. So far I have been running in the Asics Gel-Fortitude 8 in 2E width and EU size 44. I have wide feet, which is a problem in Europe, because most sports stores only stock standard widths and some companies don&rsquo;t even offer wide or extra-wide shoes in Europe, one of them being Saucony. For my next shoe, since I am trying to up my distance I wanted to go with a shoe that has a lot of cushioning.<br>
After some research i ordered the Hoka One One Clifton 7 in 2E/wide. I got them this week, but while the toebox is huge, on the mid-foot it is just too narrow for me, I could put them on, but my foot spilled over a lot. After that I asked on the RunningShoeGeeks subreddit for some recommendations for my case. Mentioned were Altras, Brooks, Saucony Triumph and New Balance 1080v10. The Saucony Triumph would have been my first order, but I was told by their european customer service, that they only offer medium width shoes in europe. I ignored the Altras for now, because they are zero-drop, coming from a 10mm drop shoe seems a bit much of a change, especially when I will still be switching between my old and new pair of shoes. I now ordered the New Balance 1080v10 in both 2E and 4E, getting them on Tuesday. I hope on of those is a good fit. Shoe shopping has always been a pain in the ass for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, thanks for taking your time to read this.</p>
